<h3 id="tribute-headline">A brief summary of Shigeru Miyamoto's life...</h3>
<li class="tribute-list"><b>1952</b> - Born in Sonobe, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan</li>
<li class="tribute-list"><b>1970</b> - He started attending 'Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts' in 1970 and five years later he graduated obtaining a degree in industrial design.</li>
<li class="tribute-list"><b>1977</b> - Through a mutual friend, Miyamoto's father arranged an interview with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. After showing some of his toy creations, Miyamoto was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in the planning department.</li>
<li class="tribute-list"><b>1980</b> - He first helped the company develop a game with the 1980 release Radar Scope. The game achieved moderate success in Japan.</li>
<li class="tribute-list"><b>1981</b> -  Nintendo's efforts to break it into the North American video game market had failed, leaving the company with a large number of unsold units and on the verge of financial collapse. In an effort to keep the company afloat, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to convert unsold Radar Scope units into a new arcade game. He tasked Miyamoto with the conversion,  about which Miyamoto has said self-deprecatingly that "no one else was available" to do the work.</li>
